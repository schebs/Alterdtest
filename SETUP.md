- Add Pierce's workshop photo for the about section
- Create favicons for browser tabs

### 2. Image Optimization
For best performance, optimize your images:
```bash
# Convert to WebP (requires webp tools)
cwebp input.jpg -q 85 -o output.webp

# Resize images to correct dimensions
# Gallery images: 800x800px
# Hero images: 1920x1080px
# Logo: 400x400px maximum
```

- `og:url` meta tag in index.html:18
- Schema.org URL in index.html:230
